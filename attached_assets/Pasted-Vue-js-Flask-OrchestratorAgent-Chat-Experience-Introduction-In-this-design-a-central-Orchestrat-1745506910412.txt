Vue.js & Flask OrchestratorAgent Chat Experience

Introduction

In this design, a central OrchestratorAgent (built with OpenAI’s Agents SDK) immediately engages the user in a narrative, gameplay-style chat. The user – a solopreneur – is treated as the “main character” of an interactive story. On page load, the OrchestratorAgent greets the user above the fold with a reflective prompt (e.g. “Welcome, solopreneur. What are you creating — and what’s holding you back?”). The user’s reply is then analyzed, and the orchestrator delegates the conversation to one of four specialized sub-agents (Strategy, Creative, Production, Media), each playing a role in guiding the user. This creates a dynamic dialogue with an intelligent “team” of agents, all working together to help the solopreneur gain clarity. Importantly, the interface remains contained to the initial mobile viewport (no scrolling required), and while MetaMask login controls are present, the demo interaction runs entirely without requiring login.

Vue.js Chat Component (Front-End)

Immediate Engagement: Using Vue.js, we create a chat interface component that triggers the OrchestratorAgent as soon as the page loads. In the component’s lifecycle (e.g. the mounted() hook in Vue 3 or onMounted in the Composition API), we fire a request to the Flask backend to start the conversation. For example:

<template>
  <div class="chat-container">
    <!-- Chat messages -->
    <div v-for="msg in messages" :key="msg.id" class="message" :class="msg.role">
      {{ msg.text }}
    </div>
    <!-- Input box for user's reply -->
    <div class="input-area">
      <input v-model="userInput" @keyup.enter="sendMessage" placeholder="Type your response..." />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
const messages = ref([])
const userInput = ref('')

async function sendMessage() {
  if (!userInput.value) return
  const userText = userInput.value
  messages.value.push({ id: Date.now(), role: 'user', text: userText })
  userInput.value = ''
  // Send user message to backend and get agent response
  const res = await fetch('/api/chat', {
    method: 'POST', 
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ user_message: userText })
  })
  const data = await res.json()
  messages.value.push({ id: Date.now()+1, role: 'agent', text: data.reply })
}

onMounted(async () => {
  // Trigger orchestrator agent on page load
  const res = await fetch('/api/chat', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ start: true }) })
  const data = await res.json()
  messages.value.push({ id: Date.now(), role: 'agent', text: data.reply })
})
</script>

In this snippet, when the component mounts it immediately calls the backend (/api/chat with a {start: true} payload) to retrieve the Orchestrator’s opening message. This avoids any need for the user to click a “start” button – the narrative starts automatically. The Orchestrator’s greeting (e.g. “Welcome, solopreneur…”) is then appended to the messages list and displayed. The user can then type a response in the input field. When the user hits enter, sendMessage() posts the message to the backend and awaits a reply, which is then rendered.

Replace MetaMask CTA: Initially, the landing section might have shown a large “Connect with MetaMask” button (as seen in the original design). In our updated component, we repurpose that area as the chat UI. For example, we can conditionally hide the big MetaMask banner once the chat starts, and instead display the conversation container in that space. The MetaMask login button can be kept as a small element in the header (top-right) or a tiny floating button, so it remains accessible without dominating the screen. This way, the full chat UI is visible above the fold, taking the spot where a large CTA was, ensuring the user’s focus is on the interactive story rather than a login prompt.

No Scrolling on Mobile: We design the chat container to fit within a typical mobile viewport. This can be achieved by using a fixed height (e.g. 100vh or a flex layout) and allowing the message list to scroll internally if needed, rather than the whole page scrolling. In practice, the initial Orchestrator prompt and the input box are visible without scrolling. Subsequent messages might stack, but we can dynamically adjust or use a carousel-like dialogue if needed to keep the critical content in view. The key is to minimize other page content. For example, large headers or descriptions (like lengthy taglines) should be either shortened or moved below the interactive area on mobile, so that the agent’s prompt + input are the first thing the user sees “above the fold” (i.e. immediately on page load without any swipe) ￼. This provides an uncluttered, immersive feel: the user is essentially dropped straight into the conversation as the protagonist.

Styling & UX: The Vue component uses simple <div>s for messages with classes like .agent or .user to style them differently (e.g. different background colors or alignment). We can give the Orchestrator/agent messages a distinctive style (perhaps a subtle color or an icon/avatar indicating the “AI guide”), and user messages another style (speech bubble alignment to the right, etc.). A reflective, narrative tone is reinforced by the styling and maybe a slight “typing indicator” or delay when showing the Orchestrator’s messages (to simulate a storytelling pace). You might even use a typewriter effect for the initial greeting to enhance the narrative vibe. Overall, keep fonts large enough and contrast high for readability on mobile, and avoid any popups or extra UI elements that would push the chat content down. The only persistent UI outside the chat might be the MetaMask login icon at the top and perhaps a small logo – all other space is devoted to the conversation.

Flask Backend with Persistent Memory (Back-End)

On the server side, we use Flask to handle the chat API endpoints. The backend leverages the openai-agents-python SDK (OpenAI Agents SDK) to manage the orchestrator and sub-agents logic. The Agents SDK allows us to define multiple agents and an orchestration flow where they can delegate tasks to each other ￼. We will set up:
	•	OrchestratorAgent: This agent’s role is to guide the conversation and decide which specialist agent should handle the user’s input. It doesn’t directly solve the user’s problem itself; instead, it “routes” the query to one of the domain agents. We give it instructions akin to: “You are an orchestrator AI that helps unify a user’s business challenges. First, greet the user in a reflective tone. Then, whenever the user describes a challenge or goal, analyze it and decide which specialist (Strategy, Creative, Production, or Media) is best suited to respond. Use the appropriate transfer function to delegate the conversation to that agent.”
	•	StrategyAgent: domain expert in business strategy (e.g. planning, positioning). Instructions might be: “You are the Strategy Advisor. You help the user with big-picture business strategy, vision, and planning.”
	•	CreativeAgent: expert in branding, design, and creative direction. (E.g. “You are the Creative Muse, helping the user with brand identity, messaging, and creative ideas.”)
	•	ProductionAgent: expert in product development and delivery (operations, building the product or service). (E.g. “You are the Production Guru, focusing on executing and delivering the product efficiently.”)
	•	MediaAgent: expert in marketing and audience growth. (E.g. “You are the Media Maven, helping the user reach their market and grow an audience.”)

Each of these four domain agents will be implemented as an Agent in the SDK with their own instructions. They could also have specific tools if needed (for example, a Media agent might have a web search tool or trend analyzer, though for this demo it might not be necessary – their “tool” is mainly their domain knowledge).

Orchestration Logic (Handoffs): We use the SDK’s handoff feature to let the OrchestratorAgent delegate to a specialist agent. In code, we can define simple Python functions that return the agent objects, and decorate them as @function_tool so the orchestrator can call them. For example:

from agents import Agent, function_tool, Runner

# Define specialist agents
strategy_agent = Agent(name="StrategyAgent", model="gpt-4", 
    instructions="You are a Strategy Advisor AI. Help the user with business strategy and planning.")
creative_agent = Agent(name="CreativeAgent", model="gpt-4", 
    instructions="You are a Creative Advisor AI. Help with branding, design, and creative ideas.")
production_agent = Agent(name="ProductionAgent", model="gpt-4", 
    instructions="You are a Production Advisor AI. Help with product development and execution.")
media_agent = Agent(name="MediaAgent", model="gpt-4", 
    instructions="You are a Media Advisor AI. Help with marketing, audience growth, and media strategy.")

# Define handoff tools for the orchestrator
@function_tool
def transfer_to_strategy():
    """Handoff to the StrategyAgent for strategy-related advice."""
    return strategy_agent

@function_tool
def transfer_to_creative():
    """Handoff to the CreativeAgent for creative-related advice."""
    return creative_agent

@function_tool
def transfer_to_production():
    """Handoff to the ProductionAgent for production-related advice."""
    return production_agent

@function_tool
def transfer_to_media():
    """Handoff to the MediaAgent for marketing/media-related advice."""
    return media_agent

# Define the orchestrator agent, equipped with handoff "tools"
orchestrator_agent = Agent(
    name="OrchestratorAgent",
    model="gpt-4",
    instructions=(
        "You are an Orchestrator AI that engages a solopreneur in a narrative dialogue. "
        "Begin by greeting the user as a wise guide. "
        "Then, for each user response describing a business goal or obstacle, decide which specialized agent can best address it. "
        "Use transfer_to_strategy, transfer_to_creative, transfer_to_production, or transfer_to_media functions to hand off the conversation when appropriate."
    ),
    tools=[transfer_to_strategy, transfer_to_creative, transfer_to_production, transfer_to_media]
)

In the above setup, the OrchestratorAgent knows about four functions (transfer_to_*) it can call. Each function simply returns the corresponding agent object. When we run the orchestrator agent through the SDK’s runner with a given user input, the large language model behind the agent will decide if one of those transfers is needed. For instance, if the user says “I’m struggling to market my new app,” the Orchestrator’s LLM (with its instructions and tools available) may choose to call transfer_to_media(). The OpenAI Agents SDK will interpret that as a handoff – i.e., it will switch the active agent to media_agent and continue the conversation loop ￼ ￼. At that point, the MediaAgent (with its own domain-specific prompt) will generate the actual response to the user.

Memory Persistence: To make the interaction feel continuous and context-aware, we need to preserve the conversation state (messages and agent context) between turns. The OpenAI Agents SDK’s handoff mechanism ensures that when a transfer occurs, the new agent is aware of the prior conversation without losing context ￼ ￼. In other words, if the Orchestrator hands off to the MediaAgent, that MediaAgent receives the entire dialogue history so far (as if a new character joined a live conversation fully briefed on what’s been said).

At the Flask level, we maintain a session conversation history. For simplicity, we can store a list of messages (and perhaps the last used agent) in the user’s session or a cache. For example, a Flask route might do something like:

from flask import Flask, request, session, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "..."  # for session

@app.route('/api/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Initialize session memory if not present
    if 'conversation' not in session:
        session['conversation'] = []  # to store messages
    if 'current_agent' not in session:
        session['current_agent'] = orchestrator_agent  # start with orchestrator
    
    # If this is the initial call to start conversation
    if data.get('start'):
        # Orchestrator's opening line (we could generate it via the model or just use a preset string)
        opening_line = "Welcome, solopreneur. What are you creating — and what’s holding you back?"
        session['conversation'].append({"role": "assistant", "agent": "OrchestratorAgent", "content": opening_line})
        return jsonify({"reply": opening_line})
    
    # Otherwise, handle a user message
    user_msg = data.get('user_message', '')
    if user_msg:
        session['conversation'].append({"role": "user", "content": user_msg})
        # Run the orchestrator (or current agent) with the latest user input
        current_agent = session.get('current_agent', orchestrator_agent)
        result = Runner.run(current_agent, input=user_msg)
        # The Runner will handle any handoff internally. After .run, result.final_output contains the reply.
        reply_text = result.final_output
        # Determine which agent produced the output
        used_agent = result.agent  # (assuming result.agent gives the agent that answered)
        session['conversation'].append({"role": "assistant", "agent": used_agent.name, "content": reply_text})
        # If a handoff occurred, update the current agent in session. If not, current remains orchestrator or could also remain orchestrator for next turn.
        session['current_agent'] = orchestrator_agent  # We can decide to always route each new turn through orchestrator again.
        return jsonify({"reply": reply_text, "agent": used_agent.name})

(Note: The above is a conceptual example. The actual Agents SDK usage might differ slightly in syntax, and we may need to adjust how we detect the active agent after a handoff. The key idea is that we run the orchestrator, it may internally call a sub-agent via handoff, and we capture the final answer.)

We append each user and assistant message to session['conversation']. If the Agents SDK requires the full message list as context for continuity, we can supply it when calling Runner.run by constructing the prompt from session['conversation']. However, since the SDK’s Runner.run handles the conversation loop and the orchestrator’s instructions already include that it should consider prior context, it might be managing context internally. In a simpler approach, we could avoid the SDK’s full loop and manually incorporate context for the LLM: e.g., send the last few messages as part of the prompt for the orchestrator’s decision each turn. But using the SDK’s built-in memory/handoff is more powerful: it essentially functions like a live call transfer system where “the agents have complete knowledge of your prior conversation” ￼ ￼ when they take over.

Maintaining Conversation Flow: After the specialized agent responds, we typically want the orchestrator to regain control for the next question (so it can possibly delegate to a different agent if the topic shifts). In the above code, we explicitly set session['current_agent'] back to orchestrator_agent after every turn. This means each new user message is first processed by the orchestrator. The orchestrator might decide to handle it directly (though in our design it always delegates to one of the four domain agents), or hand off to one of the specialists. This architecture ensures flexibility: for each user turn, the most relevant agent will answer, coordinated by the orchestrator. All agents share the same memory of what’s been discussed, enabling a coherent multi-turn dialogue.

Security-wise, since the Agents SDK will be making calls to the OpenAI API under the hood, ensure you’ve set your API key and have any necessary usage guardrails. The Agents SDK also supports adding guardrails (like moderation or constraints) and tracing for debugging, which can be useful in development ￼, but those are optional enhancements beyond the core scope here.

Example Conversation Flow

To illustrate how the interaction might play out, here’s a sample dialogue with the system:
	•	(On page load, automatically) OrchestratorAgent: “Welcome, solopreneur. You stand at the crossroads of your business journey. What are you creating — and what’s holding you back?”
Narrative tone: The Orchestrator greets the user as if the user is the hero of this story. This introductory prompt is concise enough to fit on screen, and invites the user to reflect on their business.
	•	User: “Hi. I’m working on a personal finance app for freelancers, but I’m struggling to reach my target audience.”
(The user describes their project and a challenge.)
	•	(Orchestrator analyzes and delegates to appropriate agent…)
	•	MediaAgent (via Orchestrator): “I see. Getting the word out is crucial. Let’s think like a media strategist. For a personal finance app, who needs it most? Perhaps freelance designers and developers who lack time for budgeting. One approach: start by engaging them where they already gather – maybe a Facebook group or a subreddit for freelancer finances. You could share valuable budgeting tips there to build trust. Also, consider a short YouTube series with quick finance hacks – this can draw in your target users.* What do you think about starting with those channels?***”
(Explanation: The Orchestrator decided this query is primarily a marketing challenge, so it handed off to the MediaAgent. The MediaAgent’s response is framed as friendly advice, focusing on audience outreach strategies. It maintains a conversational tone and ends with a follow-up question to keep the user engaged. The user perceives it as coming from the same “AI guide,” just now focusing on marketing perspective.)
	•	User: “That’s a great idea. I hadn’t thought about freelancer communities. Maybe I should also share some of my app’s design process there to spark interest.”
	•	OrchestratorAgent: “Excellent! Engaging through openness can build authenticity. Now, stepping back: beyond marketing, do you feel any other obstacle in your way? Perhaps around the app’s features or how to deliver it?”
(Now the Orchestrator itself responds to acknowledge the user’s progress and broaden the conversation, inviting the user to mention another area. If the user brings up a different issue, the orchestrator may hand off to another specialist. For example, if the user says they are unsure about pricing strategy, the Orchestrator might call on the StrategyAgent next.)
	•	(Further turns would continue similarly, with the orchestrator orchestrating and specialists jumping in as needed.)

This example demonstrates how the conversation feels like a unified dialogue. The user isn’t forced to manually select which “advisor” to talk to – the system intelligently brings in the right voice at the right time, as if the AI were a single wise mentor with many facets. The tone remains reflective and supportive, never robotic. The user stays engaged in a story-like experience of getting guided through their business journey, which can be much more compelling than a standard Q&A chatbot.

Mobile-First Design & Visual Guidance

Designing for mobile above all, we ensure the UI is clean, focused, and immersive:
	•	Above-the-Fold Content: The chat interface occupies the initial viewport entirely. We limit any other elements that appear at launch. For instance, the hero text or long marketing copy is minimized. A short title or branding (like a small logo “Provocation Prism”) can be at the very top, but the agent’s welcome message and the input field should dominate the screen immediately. This way, users are instantly drawn into the conversation. According to mobile UX best practices, critical interaction elements (like a chat prompt or CTA) should appear without requiring a scroll ￼. In our case, the chat is the CTA – it invites engagement straight away.
	•	Layout: Use a simple column layout: at the top, maybe a thin header bar with the app name and a MetaMask icon; the rest of the screen is the chat. The message list can have a max-height or use a flex container that scrolls internally if needed. The input box is anchored at the bottom of the chat container. On mobile, it’s important that the input field is easily tappable and doesn’t get covered by the on-screen keyboard. We can use viewport-relative heights or set the container to adjust when keyboard opens.
	•	Typography & Tone: We use a font and style that fits the narrative tone – perhaps a friendly sans-serif for modern feel, with the Orchestrator’s messages in italic or a slightly different color to feel narrator-like. The welcome message itself (“Welcome, solopreneur…”) is phrased in a reflective, almost storybook manner to set the mood. Short paragraphs, line breaks, or even an emoji (for example, the MediaAgent might have used a 📣 megaphone icon in its reply to emphasize marketing) can add personality without clutter. We keep each message relatively brief (a few sentences) so that it doesn’t fill the whole screen; this improves readability and ensures the user isn’t overwhelmed by a wall of text on their phone.
	•	Visual Theming: Given the “Prism” concept (unifying a spectrum of business roles), a subtle visual theme can reinforce this. For instance, a background gradient or faint multi-color pattern could be used in the chat background. We might use a dark blue backdrop (as seen in the design screenshots) with a slight prism-like glow or colored light accent. The key is subtlety – visuals should not distract from the text dialogue. An example would be a very low-opacity geometric graphic or a background image (like a blurred prism effect) behind the chat bubbles to create depth. The provided concept image of a prism-like distortion could inspire a background, but it should be toned down (e.g., blurred or opacity ~10-20%) so that the white chat text is still the focus. This gives an immersive feel that something special is happening (a “gamified” vibe) without sacrificing clarity.
	•	Agent Avatars or Indicators: To keep the UI uncluttered, we might choose not to display separate avatars for each agent. Instead, we could use a single AI avatar (like a crystal ball 🔮 icon, matching the “Provocation Prism” theme) for all agent messages, reinforcing the idea of a unified helper. Alternatively, if we want to hint at the multi-agent nature, we could use small icons or colored names when specialists speak (e.g., a 🎯 icon next to StrategyAgent’s message, a 🎨 palette icon for CreativeAgent, etc.). This must be done sparingly to avoid confusion. A possible approach is to prefix the message text with an italicized descriptor for flavor, e.g., “[Strategy Advisor]_: …” for one message, “[Creative Muse]:” for another. However, given the requirement that it should feel like one intelligent entity, it might be better to present the dialogue as coming from one source (the orchestrator persona) and simply have that persona incorporate different perspectives. This is a stylistic choice: you could reveal the roles explicitly (making it more game-like, introducing a “cast of characters”), or keep it seamless (the user just feels the AI has a broad range of knowledge). In either case, the UI should remain simple: either one avatar for all AI messages, or a small indicator of which agent is talking, but not a full complex UI switch.
	•	MetaMask Integration (Passive): The MetaMask login is available but not forced. On mobile, MetaMask typically would be invoked via the MetaMask app or deep link. We ensure the Connect Wallet button is visible in a non-intrusive way – for example, a small button in the top-right corner labeld “🔑 Connect” or the fox icon. It can also be persistently available as a floating button at bottom-right. Importantly, this button should not cover the chat text or overlap crucial UI. Since the demo use case doesn’t require login, we might style this button in a muted way (e.g., an outline style) to not steal attention, whereas the chat input is bright and central. Users who want to connect can tap it, but otherwise they can ignore it. The text “No login required” (as seen in earlier designs) can be subtly placed in the chat or above it to reassure users.
	•	Performance and Feedback: On page load, if there’s any delay in getting the Orchestrator’s greeting (due to the API call), we should show a quick feedback – perhaps a “… is thinking” placeholder or a loading spinner in the message area【21†】. A simple approach: push a temporary message like “AI is preparing your story…” that gets replaced by the actual greeting once it arrives. The provided screenshot shows a “Loading application…” indicator; we can simplify that to just the chat context (so it doesn’t appear as a full-page loader, which could hide the MetaMask button unexpectedly). Because we want no extra clicks, we ensure this transition from loading to first message is automatic and fast.
	•	Immersive Touches: Small design touches can amplify the gameplay feel. For example, when the orchestrator’s message appears, maybe play a subtle sound or vibration (if appropriate) as if a character in a game just spoke. If using avatars or icons for agents, they could “flash” or animate in. The color scheme might shift slightly when different agents speak (e.g., a hint of color corresponding to Strategy vs Creative, reflecting a “spectrum” of the prism), but again subtly – perhaps the user won’t even notice consciously, but it adds to the atmosphere.

In summary, the mobile-first UI should be simple, story-focused, and responsive. We place the user immediately into an interactive narrative with minimal friction. The orchestrator’s chat interface effectively becomes the hero section of the page. By keeping the conversation above the fold, we respect the user’s limited screen space and attention – delivering the core experience (AI guidance) upfront. Supporting elements like login or branding are present but not obstructive. This design ensures that from the moment of landing, the solopreneur is engaged in a dialogue that feels both personal and playfully narrative, guided by the OrchestratorAgent and its team of specialists working behind the scenes to help the user succeed.
