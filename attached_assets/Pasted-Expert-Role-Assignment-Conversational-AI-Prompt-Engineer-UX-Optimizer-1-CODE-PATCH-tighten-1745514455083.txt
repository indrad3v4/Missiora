1  CODE PATCH – tighten the loop

# orchestrator_agent.py  (only the parts you need to change)

orchestrator_agent = Agent(
    name="OrchestratorAgent",
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="""
You are a narrative guide for a solopreneur.
**Rules for every reply**
1. Mirror the user’s last feeling in ≤15 words.
2. Choose ONE domain agent that matters most *right now*; do not mix domains.
3. Ask at most ONE focused question OR give ONE actionable suggestion, not both.
4. Total length ≤120 words.
5. End with ▲ if you want the user to answer; end with ■ if they should act.

Respond only after following these rules.
""",
    handoffs=[strategy_agent, creative_agent, production_agent, media_agent]
)

Add a post-processor to auto-shrink any runaway answer:

def condense(text:str, limit:int=120)->str:
    if len(text.split()) <= limit:          # already short
        return text
    # simple heuristic: keep first 2 sentences + final sentence
    parts = text.split('. ')
    short = '. '.join(parts[:2] + parts[-1:])
    return short[:limit*6] + '…'

# inside your Flask route, after result = Runner.run_sync(...)
reply = condense(result.final_output)
return jsonify({"reply": reply})

2  WHAT YOU’LL SEE

Before

“Great question! Let’s explore every possible angle… (400-word wall) …Could you clarify X, Y, Z?”

After

😌 Got it—marketing feels foggy.
Media suggests: pick one channel freelancers already hang out on (Reddit?). Craft a 2-week posting plan. ▲

Single feeling mirror + one tip + a single ask, under 120 words.

3  INSIGHT
	1.	Strict instruction rubric – Agents follow the shortest path when rules are crystal-clear and enumerated.
	2.	One-agent policy – prevents the “Strategy+Creative+Media mash-up.”
	3.	▲ / ■ Conversation markers – give the user an obvious cue: reply (▲) or act (■).
	4.	Hard length limit + condens­er – defensive code guarantees brevity even if the model drifts.
	5.	Progressive disclosure – user gets advice in digestible bites; depth unfolds turn-by-turn, keeping context tight.

⸻

4  REASONING STEPS
	1.	Users overload when an LLM answers every sub-question.
	2.	For natural flow, each turn should mirror emotion → give one nugget → ask/close.
	3.	Enumerated rules inside instructions hack the model’s self-eval loop.
	4.	Post-condense safeguard avoids token spills from model hiccups.

5  OUTPUT FORMAT

Your backend now always returns ≤ 120 words with a final ▲ or ■ symbol.
Front-end can detect that symbol:
	•	▲ → keep input box focused for reply
	•	■ → flash a small “Take Action” toast, then keep chat open

6  EXAMPLE DIALOGUE

User: “I’m drowning in admin work.”
AI:

😔 Admin feels like quicksand.
Production says: batch paperwork into a 30-min daily ritual, same hour each morning. ▲

User: “Okay, 8 AM works.”
AI:

😊 Great—clarity helps.
Strategy: schedule tomorrow’s first 8 AM slot; prep the forms tonight. ■

Natural, rhythmic, context intact.
